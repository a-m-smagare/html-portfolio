 <h1>The Best Movies according to Anna</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Harry Potter (all parts)</h3>
 <p>A magic movie collection that allows you to escape into a complex world of magic, <br />
    filled with wonderful orchestra music and warm, nostalgic cinematography <br />
    that send you back into childhood.</p>

 <h3>Call me by your name.</h3>
 <p>A wonderful summer time movie based in Northern Italy. It reminds you of lush summers filled <br />
    with adventures and emotions and of course love. The cinematography portrays the summer vibe <br />
    so well, it leaves you inspired to go out and look for the beauty in nature.</p>

 <h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
 <p>Another classic. Inspires you to the core to create art and write your heart out.<br />
    The wonderful aesthetic of this movie transports you into the English school life of a few friends<br />
    who sneak out into the woods at night to read poetry to each other.<br />
    Inspired by their new professor, they get closer to themselves and start to live again, through poetry.</p>
