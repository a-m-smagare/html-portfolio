<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born and raised in Latvia, I spent most of my time asking big questions to the world. I have always aspired to understand the world
   and how it works in the background. Never could I use a tool and not wonder how it works. What is the "mechanism" behind it? 
   My mind lingered everywhere, no matter what it was. It could be the little flower on the sidewalk, that sent me off into a train of thoughts
   about the process of growth of plants or the games I played online, that kept me wondering how it does what I tell it to do.

<p>My curiosity towards life never left me. It has accompanied me through my whole life so far and motivated me to pursue a career where 
   my curiosity could never outreach the field. I have always seen technology as wonderful tool for creation. I love to create in art and I love to create on my laptop.
   My passion for understanding the unseen mechanics of the world naturally evolved into a love for web development. It was the perfect intersection of my curiosity and creativity. 
   I found myself fascinated not just by how websites look, but by the code and logic that bring them to lifeâ€”how something so intangible could have such a powerful impact on the world around us. 
   I am constantly inspired to build, learn, and improve.</p> 

<p>In my free time aside from learning about programming or any technology related topic, I love to spend my time with spiritual practices.
  I love doing yoga, especially in the morning, when my body is stiff from the nights sleep, and I also emjoy meditation a lot. My practices help me unwind
  and meet myself on different levels each time.<br />
  Reading has been a dear hobby of mine since I was little. It has given me a lot of comfort, especially when 
  my family moved to Germany. I enjoy English classic literature a lot. I find it very interesting to see how people spoke and acted in earlier days and therefore
  I find the storytelling fantastic.<br /> 
  Recently, I also got a puppy from my time in Italy. He lived outside in a little cage, without anything, except rotten food. 
  I love to spend time with him and see how he is growing into a confident and loving being. He is a little adventurer! I make sure to show him all the wonderful places 
  in this world he can explore freely!
